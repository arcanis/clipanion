> Type-safe CLI library with no runtime dependencies

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/clipanion.svg)](https://yarnpkg.com/package/clipanion) [![Licence](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/clipanion.svg)](https://github.com/arcanis/clipanion#license-mit) [![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/developed%20with-Yarn%202-blue)](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add clipanion
```

## Why

- Clipanion supports advanced typing mechanisms
- Clipanion supports nested commands (`yarn workspaces list`)
- Clipanion supports transparent option proxying without `--` (for example `yarn dlx eslint --fix`)
- Clipanion supports all option types you could think of (including negations, batches, ...)
- Clipanion offers a [Typanion](https://github.com/arcanis/typanion) integration for increased validation capabilities
- Clipanion generates an optimized state machine out of your commands
- Clipanion generates good-looking help pages out of the box
- Clipanion offers common optional command entries out-of-the-box (e.g. version command, help command)

Clipanion is used in [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) with great success.

## Documentation

Check the website for our documentation: [mael.dev/clipanion](https://mael.dev/clipanion/).

## Overview

Commands are declared by extending from the `Command` abstract base class, and more specifically by implementing its `execute` method which will then be called by Clipanion. Whatever exit code it returns will then be set as the exit code for the process:

```ts
class SuccessCommand extends Command {
    async execute() {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Commands can also be exposed via one or many arbitrary paths using the `paths` static property:

```ts
class FooCommand extends Command {
    static paths = [[`foo`]];
    async execute() {
        this.context.stdout.write(`Foo\n`);
    }
}

class BarCommand extends Command {
    static paths = [[`bar`]];
    async execute() {
        this.context.stdout.write(`Bar\n`);
    }
}
```

Options are defined as regular class properties, annotated by the helpers provided in the `Option` namespace. If you use TypeScript, all property types will then be properly inferred with no extra work required:

```ts
class HelloCommand extends Command {
    // Positional option
    name = Option.String();

    async execute() {
        this.context.stdout.write(`Hello ${this.name}!\n`);
    }
}
```

Option arguments can be validated and coerced using the [Typanion](https://mael.dev/typanion/) library:

```ts
class AddCommand extends Command {
    a = Option.String({required: true, validator: t.isNumber()});
    b = Option.String({required: true, validator: t.isNumber()});

    async execute() {
        this.context.stdout.write(`${this.a + this.b}\n`);
    }
}
```
